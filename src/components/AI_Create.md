AI Integration Documentation for ToolkitCreator
Overview
The AI integration in ToolkitCreator provides intelligent assistance for content generation across different levels of the toolkit creation process.
AI Integration Points
1. Process Phase Assistant

Purpose: Generate comprehensive phase descriptions
Trigger: Magic wand button next to phase description

Sample Prompt:
"Given a process phase '{phaseName}', generate a detailed description that includes:
- Main objectives of this phase
- Expected outcomes
- Key stakeholders involved
- Typical duration or timeline
- Critical success factors"

Example:
Input: "Research & Discovery"
Expected Output: "The Research & Discovery phase focuses on gathering and analyzing information about user needs, market conditions, and technical requirements. This foundational phase typically spans 2-4 weeks and involves stakeholders from product, design, and research teams..."

2. Subphase Assistant

Purpose: Generate detailed subphase objectives and deliverables
Trigger: Magic wand button next to subphase description

Sample Prompt:
"Given a process phase '{phaseName}' and its subphase '{subphaseName}', generate a detailed description including:
- Specific objectives of this subphase
- Key deliverables
- Required activities
- Common challenges and how to address them
- Connection to overall phase goals"

Example:
Input: Phase: "Research & Discovery", Subphase: "User Research"
Expected Output: "User Research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical observation and feedback analysis. Key deliverables include user personas, journey maps, and research findings report..."

3. Tool Overview Assistant

Purpose: Generate comprehensive tool descriptions
Trigger: Magic wand button next to tool overview

Sample Prompts:

For Traditional Tools:
"Given a traditional tool '{toolName}' used in the {phaseName} phase, generate an overview that covers:
- Primary purpose and use cases
- Key benefits
- Target users
- Integration with workflow
- Typical implementation scenario"

For AI Tools:
"Given an AI tool '{toolName}' used in the {phaseName} phase, generate an overview that includes:
- AI capabilities and technologies used
- Automation benefits
- Comparison with traditional methods
- Implementation requirements
- Integration considerations"

Example:
Input: Tool: "Figma" (Traditional), Phase: "Design"
Expected Output: "Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that enables real-time design and prototyping. It streamlines the design process through cloud-based collaboration..."

this is good start 

However we have to make sure there is ability to delet the process, substeps and tools 

Also review the section UI and see the contnet thats coming from back we need to make sure we need to include all those for users to input 

What i mean is we need to make sure we get enough information for AI to assist. 

or do you think AI can create decprition jsut by Process name and subprocess names ?

You're right on both points! Let's:
Ensure all delete functionality works
Add more detailed inputs that match our backend requirements and help AI provide better assistance
Here's how we can enhance the form:
;
Key improvements:
Added detailed descriptions for each level
Added feature management for tools
Clear delete buttons at every level
Better placeholders to guide users
More structured tool information
For AI assistance, we now collect:
Process phase name and detailed description
Subphase name and objectives
Tool details including:
Name
Overview
Features list
Website
Logo
Would you like me to:
Add the update/delete helper functions?
Add validation for required fields?
Add AI-powered suggestions for descriptions?
Show the AI tools column implementation?
What do you think shall we make users see the AI in working or do it backend? also lot of error in the code @ToolkitCreator.tsx 

I think showing AI in action on the frontend would provide better user experience and immediate feedback. Let's fix the errors and add AI assistance. Here's how we can structure it:
;
Key additions:
Added AI suggestion generation with loading states
Added AI buttons next to inputs
Structured prompts based on context
Visual feedback during generation
Next steps could be:
Implement the actual fetchAISuggestion function with your AI service
Add error handling and retry logic
Improve prompt engineering
Add more specific AI suggestions for different parts
Would you like me to:
Show the fetchAISuggestion implementation?
Add more sophisticated prompt engineering?
Add error handling and retry logic?
Complete the rest of the component with AI integration?

Let's fix these TypeScript errors. First, we need to define the fetchAISuggestion function and fix the type issues:
;
Key fixes:
Added fetchAISuggestion implementation
Fixed type definitions for update functions
Properly typed the form data structure
Added proper error handling
Would you like me to:
Show the complete component with all the fixed types?
Add more robust error handling?
Improve the AI suggestion implementation?
Add loading states and error messages in the UI?

		}
	],
	"modelVersionId": 91
}]

Let's fix these type errors. The main issue is with the ProcessStep and Tool types. We need to properly type the fields and add the missing functions:
;
Key fixes:
Added MutableProcessStep interface for form state
Fixed type signatures for all update functions
Added missing updateToolFeature function
Fixed scope issues in generateAISuggestion
5. Added proper type constraints for field parameters
Would you like me to:
Show the complete JSX with all the fixed function calls?
Add validation for the form fields?
Improve the AI suggestion implementation?
Add error handling UI components?

	"startColumn": 93,
	"endLineNumber": 582,
	"endColumn": 105,
	"modelVersionId": 92
}]

Ah, I see the error. We're using featureIndex in the JSX but it's not defined. Let's fix that in the tool rendering part:
}
The error was occurring because we were trying to use featureIndex directly in the addToolFeature call, but it wasn't defined in that context. The fixed version properly maps over the features array and uses the featureIndex from the map function.
Would you like me to:
Show the complete component with all the fixed mappings?
Add validation for the features?
Add drag-and-drop reordering for features?
Improve the feature input UI?
So this is good but I dont see ablitty add Ai alternative tools. secondly we cant remove the tools as well

You're right! Let's add the AI tools section and ensure all delete functionality works. Here's the updated tools grid section:
>
Key changes:
Added complete AI tools section with purple theme
Added delete functionality for both traditional and AI tools
Added image upload capability for both sections
Consistent styling between traditional and AI sections
Full feature management for both tool types
Would you like me to:
Add drag-and-drop reordering for tools?
Add validation for required fields?
Improve the image upload preview?
Add tooltips for better UX?
this is good I see the icon og magic bar right so when users press that will the AI assistant upppose to work?

Yes! The magic wand (Wand2) button triggers the AI assistance. Let me show you how it works and where we can add it for different sections:
;
The AI assistance works in several ways:
For process steps: Generates detailed descriptions of the phase
For subphases: Generates objectives and deliverables
For tools: Generates tool overviews and features
Shows loading state with spinning animation
Handles errors gracefully
Would you like me to:
Add more specific prompts for different tool types?
Add error feedback in the UI?
3. Add success notifications?
Add undo functionality for AI suggestions?
so one last thing can we move up the website field for tools of both traditon and Ai alternativee above overview

Yes, let's reorder the fields to put the website URL above the overview. Here's the updated tool details section for both traditional and AI tools:
>
Key changes:
Moved website URL field above the overview
Maintained consistent spacing with space-y-2
Kept all AI assistance functionality
Added conditional placeholder text for AI vs traditional tools
Would you like me to:
Add URL validation?
Add a "Visit Website" button?
Add an icon to the URL field?
Improve the field styling?
Now make a detailed documentation of how we can integrate here dont code just documentation
